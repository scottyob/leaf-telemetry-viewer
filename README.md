# Leaf Telemetry Viewer

This is a Telemetry Viewer for the [Leaf Vario Project](https://github.com/DangerMonkeys/leaf).  It takes the binary data, will show graphs of some of the data, and enable exporting it into more verbose JSON or CSV file formats.

This project provides a simple way of adding in additional computed fields for the purpose of testing new algorithms using existing collected Telemetry data.

This is a work in progress, and the telemetry format has not yet been merged into the main branch.


## Using

Either fork this, and follow the instructions below to add additional computed fields, or use the hosted [Leaf Telemetry Viewer](https://scottyob.github.io/leaf-telemetry-viewer/)

To get you started, you can use the [Demo Telemetry File](assets/demo_telemetry.dat) to get you started.

Once you load in a telemetry file (button at the top), you'll be shown something like this:
![default hardware view](assets/hardware_climb_rate.png)

You can click and drag on any of the graphs to Zoom in
![Zoom](assets/zoom.png)

The red areas shown are a positive climb rate.  Some algorithms are better than *others*

![bad climb rate](assets/bad_climb_rate.png)

In the examples above, you can see that the Leaf v0.0.6 algorithm with default sensitivity is not very good at detecting the edges of a climb.  It will be positive just after the start of a climb, and nevative just after the start of a descent.

Exporting to a csv will yield something like this:

## Adding in new computed fields

1. Modify `src/additionalTelemetry.ts` to add in your new computed fields.
2. (optionally) add in a file to `src/dataSources/` to add the logic for computing your field.
3. Modify the `GetTelemetry` function in `src/additionalTelemetry.ts` to add in your new computed field.

If your new field is a new **Climb Rate Algorithm**, then you can change `src/components/liftModelSelector.tsx` to add in a new option for the user to select it.


## ðŸ§ž Commands to Get you Started Developing

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
